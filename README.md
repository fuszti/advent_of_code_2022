# advent_of_code_2022
The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is an advent calendar with programming tasks. You have to solve 2 algorithmic problems on each day. I challenge myself to solve them by data scientist tools. So you will see pandas, numpy, torch or datatable tricks here. The tasks are not data scientist tasks, so you can find easier or faster solutions. Perhaps you sometimes find my solutions too artificial. But I try to use the data scientist tool as meaningful way as I can.

I share my solutions in Jupyter Notebook format, so you can open them on Google Colab and can run easily.
